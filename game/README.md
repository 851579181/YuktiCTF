Sorry, I did not have time to wrote an elaborate readme. I have tried to comment the  code wherever necessary, the rest I think is mostly the syntactical memorization.

Besides, there is one thing: this code was entirely made on phaser.io/sandbox - until we don't get an HTML environment to test our game locally, I think we will have to rely on this.
The code needs to be manually copied there. Function by function. The print() function in second_phase.js comes under the update section.

Will keep updating. Thank you. :)
